The sphingamide compounds were rationally designed based upon 3D structural considerations in relation to the structures of each of CD1d, the iNKT cell TCR, and the ternary complex CD1d-a-GalCer analog lipids-TCR. More specifically, the addition of an amide in the phytosphingosine tail of a derivative of α-GalCer led to a non-conserved binding with CD1d, a conserved binding with the iNKT cell TCR, and an antagonist-like phenotype.",58695596,"la jolla inst allergy & immunology [us]

method of detecting new immunogenic t cell epitopes and isolating new antigen-specific t cell receptors by means of an mhc cell library,"The present invention relates to the field of immunotherapy, in particular, to adoptive T cell therapy, T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy and vaccination. The invention provides a method for preparing a nucleic acid encoding the TCR alpha chain construct (TRA) and TCR beta chain construct (TRB) of a TCR construct specific for an epitope from an antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC), comprising contacting T cells isolated from a donor with a library of artificial antigen presenting cells (APC) comprising cells expressing all MHC I or MHC II alleles present in the donor, preferably, in K562 cells. The TCR construct can be expressed in a T cell, which is useful for adoptive T cell therapy, e.g., of cancer, viral infections or autoimmune diseases. The invention further provides a method for identifying the epitope recognized by said TCR. Immunogenic epitopes recognized by said TCRs can be used to develop vaccine formulations to induce antigen-specific T cell immunity in patients. The invention further provides pairs of two TCR constructs and respective immunogenic epitopes obtained by the method of the invention, wherein the epitopes are from human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 (also designated alphapapillomavirus 9) oncoprotein E5 and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) protein pp65.",52669552,"max delbrueck centrum fuer molekulare medizin helmholtz gemeinschaft [de]

composition of ny-eso-1-specific t cell receptors restricted on multiple major histocompatibility complex molecules,"Tumor-specific T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer enables specific and potent immune targeting of tumor antigens. The canonical cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1, is not expressed in normal tissues but is aberrantly expressed across a broad array of cancer types. It has also been targeted with A2-restricted TCR gene therapy without adverse events or notable side effects. To enable the targeting of NY-ESO-1 in a broader array of HLA haplotypes, we isolated TCRs specific for NY-ESO-1 epitopes presented by four MHC molecules: HLA-A2, -B07, -B18, and -C03. Using these TCRs, we have developed an approach to extend TCR gene therapies targeting NY-ESO-1 to patient populations beyond those expressing HLA-A2.",70331520,"univ california [us]

personalized medicine therapeutic minicircle,"Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have emerged as a class of promising anti-cancer and anti-infection biological drugs. They are capable of killing target cells, either cancer cells or microbe-infected cells, at levels of nanograms per milliliter serum in vivo, about 1e+5 folds more powerful than regular antibodies. To bypass the problems of high cost in production and inconvenience in administration, a logical solution is to use gene therapy vectors to produce them in vivo. In a series of preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that DNA MiniCircle was able to express far above therapeutic levels of bsAB persistently both in the presence as well as the absence of transfection co-factors. As a specific and intended improvement of the claimed invention, an enhanced form of bispecific antibodies incorporating a target cell-effector cell bridging device (BTEC) is additionally disclosed.",63791375,"syno minicircle biotechnology co ltd [cn]

","The present invention relates to novel tumor-associated antigens, which elicit independently from a presentation via MHC a CD8-positive T-cell response. GM-CSF-Receptor alpha chain (CSF2RA) and Tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) were found to be targets of CD8-positive T-cell clones which could detect the proteins on the surface of HLA I negative melanoma cells. Thus, the invention provides proteins, protein fragments and polypeptides of the novel antigens for use in medicine, for example for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of a tumor disease. Furthermore provided are nucleic acids expressing the antigens of the invention, binding agents specific for the antigens of the invention, such as T-cell receptor chains and isolated T cells which are reactive against the antigens of the invention or which express the T-cell receptors of the invention. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions, especially vaccine compositions, comprising the antigens, nucleic acids, binding agents or T cells in accordance with the invention, and methods for the generation of T cells, which are specifically reactive to the antigens of the invention in an MHC-independent manner.",47355928,"universitätsmedizin der johannes gutenberg universität mainz [de]

receptor modulators,"Method of identifying a modulator of CD28 comprising comparing a structural model of a candidate modulator with a structural model of CD28 to thereby determine whether the modulator will bind to CD28, wherein the structural model is derived from, or comprises, structural coordinates of a crystal of: (i) CD28, (ii) a fragment of CD28, or (iii) a homolog of (i) or (ii). The crystal of CD28 in a soluble form complexed with the Fab fragment of a mitogenic (superagonistic) antibody has been obtained and used for the determination of the 3D-structure of the receptor. The application also relates to modulators of superagonistic signalling for any receptor of the CD28 family, i.e. to superagonistic antibodies and chimeric proteins thereof, and to the screening of the superagonistic modulators. In the methods of screening, the binding of the candidate modulators to a portion of the receptor proximal to the cell membrane is investigated.",31503665,"davis simon [gb]

quantitative assessment of human t-cell repertoire recovery after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"A method and an apparatus are provided for determining T-cell repertoire recovery after allo-HSCT or identifying patients at high risk of infection. Combination of 5′-RACE PCR with deep sequencing was used to quantify TCR diversity in 33 individuals using a single oligonucleotide pair. Analysis of duplicate blood samples revealed highly reproducible detection of expanded TCR clonotypes. After 6 months, recipients of cord blood grafts without anti-thymocyte globulin therapy approximated the TCR diversity of healthy subjects, whereas recipients of T-cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell grafts had a 28-fold and 14-fold lower CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell diversity, respectively. After 12 months, these differences had leveled out for the CD4+, but not the CD8+ T-cell compartment.",49882508,"sloan kettering inst cancer [us]

"high affinity hiv t cell receptors
","The present invention provides TCRs having high affinity. The TCR binds to SLYNTVATL (SEQ ID NO:16)-HLA-A*0201 with a KD of less than or equal to 1 muM and/or an off-rate (koff) of 1×10-3 S-1 or slower using Surface Plasmon Resonance. The TCRs are non-native, isolated or recombinant. The TCRs are useful, either alone, or with a therapeutic agent, for targeting HIV infected cells that present the SLYNTVATL (SEQ ID NO:16)-HLA-A*0201 complex.",37053744,"immunocore ltd [gb]

engineering t cell receptors,"The use of model T cell receptors (TCRs) as scaffolds for in vitro engineering of novel specificities is provided. TCRs with de novo binding to a specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) product can be isolated by: 1) mutagenizing a T cell receptor protein coding sequence to generate a variegated population of mutants (a library), 2) selection of the library of TCR mutants with the specific peptide-MHC, using a process of directed evolution and a “display” methodology (e.g., yeast, phage, mammalian cell) and the peptide-MHC ligand. The process can be repeated to identify TCR variants with improved affinity for the selecting peptide-MHC ligand.",49997854,"univ illinois [us]

triple transgenic mouse model of autoimmune disease and nf-kappa b in vivo imaging,"The present invention provides for monitoring of NF-[kappa]B-associated inflammation in mice undergoing Id-driven autoimmune disease. The mice are triple transgenic mice expressing both Id+ B cells and Id-specific CD4+ T cells as well as a luciferase reporter transgene under NF-[kappa]B control. NF-[kappa]B activation and nuclear translocation of NF-[kappa]B, luciferase activity are repeatedly monitored in intact mice by whole body bioluminescence imaging. Results are corroborated at the cellular level by detection of luciferase protein expression in single cells. The results show that imaging of NF-[kappa]B activation permits early detection of subclinical disease as well as tracking of disease development.",44063108,,"bogen bjarne [no]

neoantigen identification with pan-allele models,"A method for identifying neoantigens that are likely to be presented by MHC alleles on a surface of tumor cells of a subject. Peptide sequences of the tumor neoantigens and of the MHC alleles are obtained by sequencing the tumor cells of the subject. The peptide sequences of the tumor neoantigens and of the MHC alleles are input into a machine-learned presentation model to generate presentation likelihoods for the tumor neoantigens, each presentation likelihood representing the likelihood that a neoantigen is presented by at least one of the MHC alleles on the surface of the tumor cells of the subject. A subset of the neoantigens is selected based on the presentation likelihoods.",67806416,"gritstone oncology inc [us]

The crystal of CD28 in a soluble form complexed with the Fab fragment of a mitogenic (superagonistic) antibody has been obtained and used for the determination of the 3D-structure of the receptor. The application also relates to modulators of superagonistic signalling for any receptor of the CD28 family, i.e. to superagonistic antibodies and chimeric proteins thereof, and to the screening of the superagonistic modulators. In the methods of screening, the binding of the candidate modulators to a portion of the receptor proximal to the cell membrane is investigated.",31503665,"isis innovation [gb]

preparation of libraries of protein variants expressed in eukaryotic cells and use for selecting binding molecules,"To provide methods of producing eukaryotic cell libraries encoding a repertoire of binding molecules (""binders"").SOLUTION: The methods use a site-specific nuclease for targeted cleavage of cellular DNA to enhance site-specific integration of binder genes through endogenous cellular repair mechanisms. Populations of eukaryotic cells are produced in which a repertoire of genes encoding binders are integrated into a desired locus in cellular DNA (e.g., a genomic locus) allowing expression of the encoded binding molecule, thereby creating a population of cells expressing different binders.SELECTED DRAWING: None",50980562,"iontas ltd

engineering t cell receptor,"PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide the use of a model T cell receptor (TCR) as a scaffold for in vitro engineering of a novel specificity.SOLUTION: According to the present invention, there is provided a TCR with de novo binding to a specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) product. Here, the product can be isolated by: (1) inducing mutagenesis of a T cell receptor protein coding sequence to generate a variegated population of mutants (a library), and (2) selection of the library of TCR mutants with the specific peptide-MHC, using a process of directed evolution and a ""display"" methodology (e.g., yeast, phage, mammalian cell) and the peptide-MHC ligand. The process can be repeated to identify TCR variants with improved affinity for the selecting peptide-MHC ligand.SELECTED DRAWING: None",49997854,"board of trustees of the univ of illinois

sphingamide compounds and methods for binding inkt cells,"The compounds, compositions and methods provided herein antagonize, inhibit, decrease, reduce, suppress, or disrupt CD1d-mediated, iNKT cell-mediated, and/or iNKT cell TCR-mediated immune signaling. The sphingamide compounds were rationally designed based upon 3D structural considerations in relation to the structures of each of CD1d, the iNKT cell TCR, and the ternary complex CD1d-a-GalCer analog lipids-TCR. More specifically, the addition of an amide in the phytosphingosine tail of a derivative of ?-GalCer led to a non-conserved binding with CD1d, a conserved binding with the iNKT cell TCR, and an antagonist-like phenotype.",58695596,"la jolla inst for allergy and immunology [us]

composition of ny-eso-1-specific t cell receptors restricted on multiple major histocompatibility complex molecules,"Tumor-specific T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer enables specific and potent immune targeting of tumor antigens. The canonical cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1, is not expressed in normal tissues but is aberrantly expressed across a broad array of cancer types. It has also been targeted with A2-restricted TCR gene therapy without adverse events or notable side effects. To enable the targeting of NY-ESO-1 in a broader array of HLA haplotypes, we isolated TCRs specific for NY-ESO-1 epitopes presented by four MHC molecules: HLA-A2, -B07, -B18, and -C03. Using these TCRs, we have developed an approach to extend TCR gene therapies targeting NY-ESO-1 to patient populations beyond those expressing HLA-A2.",70331520,"univ california [us]

t cell receptors,The present invention relates to T cell receptors (TCRs) which bind the HLA-A2 restricted CLGGLLTMV peptide derived from the LMP2A protein from Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). TCRs of the invention comprise a TCR alpha chain variable domain and/or a TCR beta variable domain. Certain preferred TCRs also bind the natural peptide variants SLGGLLTMV and CLGGLITMV presented as a peptide-HLA-A2 complex. The TCRs of the invention demonstrate excellent specificity profiles for those LMP2A epitopes and have binding affinities for the complex which result in an enhanced ability to recognize the complex compared to a soluble reference TCR having the extracellular sequence of the native EBV LMP2A TCR alpha chain given in Figure 3 (SEQ ID No: 4) and the extracellular sequence of the native EBV LMP2A TCR beta chain given in Figure 4 (SEQ ID No: 5),49262046,"immunocore ltd [gb]
